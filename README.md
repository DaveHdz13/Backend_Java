# JAVA POO Practices
## Modeling
In this example we are choosing **5 characters from Harry Potter** only to use **abstracition** about data of each one of them.

I created a diagram for every character I used:

> For a general view you can check an easy diagram of every character I picked to model.
**[Diagram here!](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO722ibo=/?share_link_id=586921336453)**

We are using **Setters and Getters** for some examples and the **Constructor** for the rest.

> Hermione's example:
![SettersGetters](/screenshots/SettersGetters.png)

> Luna's example:
![Constructor](/screenshots/Constructor.png)

The result should be like this for every one of the examples:

![HermioneResult](/screenshots/Hermione.png)
