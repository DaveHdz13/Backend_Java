# JAVA POO Practices
## Modeling
In this example we are choosing **5 characters from Harry Potter** only to use **abstracition** about data of each one of them.

I created a diagram for every character I used:

> For a general view you can check the diagram of every character I picked to model.
**[Expecto Patronum!](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO722ibo=/?share_link_id=586921336453)**

We are using **Setters and Getters** for some examples and the **Constructor** for the rest.

**Hermione's example**:

**Luna's example**:

> The result looks like this for every one of the examples:
![HermioneResult](/screenshots/Results/Hermione.png)

> See all result screenshots **[Wingardium Leviosa!](/screenshots/Results/)**

## Inheritance and Polimorfism
This next concepts are based on a **singular character** who can do **different tasks** and have **different roles**.

**Octocat is our character!**

And we took 6 different versions of him from the **[Octodex](https://octodex.github.com)**.

Octocat as:

| Octonaut | Private Investocat | Boxertocat |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![Octonaut](/screenshots/OctocatScreenshots/octonaut.jpg) | ![PrivateInvestocat](/screenshots/OctocatScreenshots/privateinvestocat.jpg) | ![Boxertocat](/screenshots/OctocatScreenshots/boxertocat_octodex.jpg) 

| Filmotocat | Steroidtocat | Topguntocat |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![Filmotocat](/screenshots/OctocatScreenshots/filmtocat.png) | ![Steroidtocat](/screenshots/OctocatScreenshots/steroidtocat.png) | ![Topguntocat](/screenshots/OctocatScreenshots/topguntocat.png) |

> All outputs look like this:
![OctonautOutput](/screenshots/OctocatScreenshots/Results/Octocat%2001.png)

The **Role** is where we specified what actions does each one has. (**[All Outputs Here!](/screenshots/OctocatScreenshots/Results/)**)

## Interfaces
On this next practice we are using Spiderman characters, specifically from the **SpiderVerse Comics**.

We are searching for a base character, in this case is the **original** Spiderman (earth-616).

![Spiderman](/screenshots/SpiderVersions/Spiderman.jpg)

And we are taking some of his **moves** that aplies to other **Spidermen characters**.

In the next **Diagram** I tried to make the basic moves and for the other interfaces I put moves from other **Spidermen**.

I took 3 different Spiderman:

| Ghost Spider | Cosmic Spiderman | Superior Spiderman |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![SpidermanGR](/screenshots/SpiderVersions/SpidermanGR.jpg) | ![SpidermanC](/screenshots/SpiderVersions/SpidermanCosmic.jpg) | ![SpidermanS](/screenshots/SpiderVersions/Superior%20Spiderman.png) | 

> The output for **Ghost Spider** looks like this:
